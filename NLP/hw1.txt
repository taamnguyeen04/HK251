Home Exercise on Linear Regression
Task Description
Implement a linear regression model using gradient descent, Adam, any other optimization method to optimize the parameters or closed-form solution. (You can use other variations of Linear Regression, such as Lasso, Ridge, etc, but you must implement them yourself.)

 
You are only allowed to use computational libraries such as NumPy, Math, etc for implementing the model and training process.
You must not use machine learning libraries or frameworks like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. that provide pre-built models.
For other tasks (e.g., data processing, visualization), you are free to use any library.
After implementing the model, use it to solve the following problem: Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-data-for-ml-course)
